sh run-zero.sh # runs bench-zero.hs 3 times with different optimization degrees which produces:
               # graph-O0.svg
               # graph-O1.svg
               # graph-O2.svg
               # bench-zero.txt

# manually inline data from bench-zero.txt in bench-zero-fromtxt.hs

haskell bench-zero-fromtxt # produces 3 .svg that are scaled in relation to eachother:
                           # O0.svg
                           # O1.svg
                           # O2.svg

# we could automate the 2nd step making the .txt parseable by bench-zero-fromtxt and just run run-zero.sh
# but my goal for today is complete
